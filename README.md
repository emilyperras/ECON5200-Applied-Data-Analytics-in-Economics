# ECON5200-Applied-Data-Analytics-in-Economics


# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This repository serves as my digital portfolio for **ECON 5200: Applied Data Analytics in Economics**. It showcases my coursework, labs, and applied projects at the intersection of economic theory, statistics, and modern data science.

## 👋 About Me

I am an **undergraduate economics student** actively seeking opportunities in **Data Analysis, Economic Consulting, and Finance**.  
My academic interests focus on bridging **traditional economic reasoning**—such as causal inference and structural thinking—with **scalable, data-driven methods** used in industry today.

This portfolio reflects my progression toward becoming a data-literate economist who can both **interpret models economically** and **implement them computationally**.

## 📁 About This Portfolio

This repository contains applied coursework and lab assignments from **ECON 5200**, designed to demonstrate how core econometric concepts extend naturally into machine learning frameworks.

### Course Philosophy: Concept Extension  
Rather than treating econometrics and machine learning as separate disciplines, this course follows a **Concept Extension** approach:

- Start with foundational statistical tools (e.g., linear regression, hypothesis testing)
- Extend them using modern machine learning techniques (e.g., Lasso, regularization, cross-validation)
- Emphasize both **causal inference** and **predictive performance**

Through these projects, I am learning how to:
- Balance interpretability with prediction accuracy  
- Evaluate models using economic intuition and empirical rigor  
- Apply data-driven tools to real-world economic questions
