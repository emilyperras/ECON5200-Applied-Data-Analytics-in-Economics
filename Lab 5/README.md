# Lab 5 — Monte Carlo Engine  
### Probabilistic Modeling & Risk Simulation

This lab introduces **Monte Carlo simulation** as a framework for modeling uncertainty and quantifying risk in economic and business environments. Rather than relying on deterministic formulas, probabilistic models generate thousands of simulated outcomes to evaluate possible futures.

The project progresses from statistical foundations to applied risk analysis:

- **Law of Large Numbers:** Simulated repeated coin flips to demonstrate convergence and statistical stability over time.
- **Conditional Probability Simulation:** Modeled the Monty Hall problem to illustrate Bayesian updating through repeated experimentation.
- **Business Risk Modeling:** Built a Monte Carlo engine to simulate revenue uncertainty for a SaaS company and estimate **Value at Risk (VaR)**.
- **Stress Testing:** Compared normal distributions with fat-tailed scenarios to analyze how extreme events affect risk exposure.

### Key Concepts
Monte Carlo Simulation • Probabilistic Modeling • Law of Large Numbers • Bayesian Reasoning • Value at Risk (VaR) • Fat Tails & Risk Management

This lab demonstrates how simulation-based methods transform uncertainty into measurable risk, a core tool in modern finance, economics, and data science.
